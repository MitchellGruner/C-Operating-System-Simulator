# C-Operating-System-Simulator
A C++ application that allows the user to use a set of predefined linux commands, such as ‘touch’, ‘ls’, and ‘cd’, to emulate a working OS.

'Homework5.cpp' is the only file with the actual source code for the project.

This project was used for a homework assignment in CSc 139 in California State University, Sacramento.  I came up with all of the code
for the assignment, but it was derived from specifications outlined in the homework.
